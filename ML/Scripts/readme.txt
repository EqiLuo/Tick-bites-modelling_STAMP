The 'SQL_Query file' has codes used to clean and process the RIVM data. PgAdmin was used for this purpose.
The 'SD_VPD_formula(.py) file' has the code used to calculate the saturation deficit and the vapour pressure deficit, using PyCharm.
The 'ML_Preprocessing_TickActivity(.ipynb) file' was to train our dataset and predict values to be used as input for the ABM. Jupyter notebook was used for this purpose.
